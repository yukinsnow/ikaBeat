Authors
=======

Vamp and the Vamp SDK were designed and made at the Centre for Digital
Music at Queen Mary, University of London.

The SDK was written by Chris Cannam, copyright (c) 2005-2009
Chris Cannam and QMUL.

Mark Sandler and Christian Landone provided ideas and direction, and
Mark Levy, Dan Stowell, Martin Gasser and Craig Sapp provided testing
and other input for the 1.0 API and SDK.  The API also uses some ideas
from prior plugin systems, notably DSSI (http://dssi.sourceforge.net)
and FEAPI (http://feapi.sourceforge.net).
